The Catering Management System (CMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to enhance the efficiency of catering services by integrating key functions
such as menu management, order processing, and user sign-up into a centralized system. The primary actors interacting with the CMS are the customers
and the admin. Customers can sign up, log in, view the menu, place orders, and manage their orders. The admin has capabilities such as checking the order list,
assigning staff to orders, and managing the menu items. This system aims to streamline the catering process, making it easier for businesses to handle daily operations,
reduce complexity, and ensure a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.

The system includes both functional and non-functional requirements to ensure robust performance and security. Functional requirements cover menu management,
order processing, and user management, allowing users to perform tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting menu items and orders.
Non-functional requirements emphasize performance, safety, security, and software quality attributes, ensuring the system can handle up to 100 concurrent users
without degradation, encrypts user data, and complies with GDPR regulations. The CMS is designed to be reliable, portable, maintainable, and user-friendly, 
making it accessible on various devices and easy to navigate. This comprehensive approach ensures that the CMS can significantly improve the operational efficiency
of catering businesses, enhancing productivity and customer satisfaction.
